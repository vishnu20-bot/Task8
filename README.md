## VPN Privacy and Secure Communication Report

##  Objective
Understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting user privacy and ensuring secure communication over the internet.

## Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
- IP Check Tool: [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

#1. VPN Setup Steps

1. **Sign Up:**  
   - Created a free account on ProtonVPN.  

2. **Download & Install:**  
   - Installed ProtonVPN client on Windows system.  

3. **Connect to VPN:**  
   - Selected the **nearest available server** for better speed.  
   - Successfully connected to ProtonVPN.

4. **Verify IP Change:**  
   - Before VPN: Original IP → `223.187.54.60` (India)  
   - After VPN: New IP → `188.226.160.91` ( Server Location NETHERLANDS )  

5. **Browse to Test Encryption:**  
   - Accessed multiple websites without issues.  
   - Verified traffic was encrypted using HTTPS and VPN tunnel.

6. **Disconnect & Compare:**  
   - After disconnecting, IP reverted to original.  
   - Speed difference noted: VPN ON (slower) vs VPN OFF (faster).

## 3. VPN Encryption & Privacy Features
- **Encryption:** AES-256-bit encryption with strong key exchange protocols (OpenVPN, IKEv2).  
- **Privacy:**  
  - Hides original IP address and location.  
  - Prevents ISP tracking and snooping on public Wi-Fi.  
  - Protects against some forms of surveillance and censorship.  

## 4. Benefits of Using a VPN

- Protects sensitive data from hackers on public networks.  
- Hides IP address for better privacy and anonymity.  
- Allows access to geo-restricted content.  
- Adds an extra layer of security when working remotely.

## 5. Limitations of Free VPNs

- Limited server options → affects speed and latency.  
- Data caps (500MB – 10GB monthly in free plans).  
- Some free VPNs may log user data → risk of privacy issues.  
- Slower speeds due to shared servers.

##  Summary

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) play a vital role in modern cybersecurity by encrypting internet traffic and masking the user's IP address. This ensures privacy, prevents ISP monitoring, and secures communication on public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs create an encrypted tunnel between the user’s device and the VPN server, making it extremely difficult for hackers or surveillance systems to intercept data.

During the practical exercise, I Have observed:

- The IP address changed successfully when connected to a VPN.

- Browsing traffic remained encrypted, confirmed by HTTPS and VPN tunnel.

- There was a slight reduction in speed due to encryption overhead and server distance.
